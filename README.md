   A. JavaScript Arrays 
   Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.

   "var courses = new Array("HTML", "CSS", "JS");"

   B. The length Property
   JavaScript arrays have useful built-in properties and methods.An array's length property returns the number of it's elements.

      "array.length()"

   C. Associative Arrays 
   JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.In JS, arrays always use numbered indexes. It is better to use an object when you want the index to be a string (text). Use an array when you want the index to be a number.

   D. Math Object Methods
   To get a random number between 1-10, use Math.random(), which gives you a number between 0-1. Then multiply the number by 10, and then take Math.ceil() from it: Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10).
